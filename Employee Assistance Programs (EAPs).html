		<h2>Faculty Staff Help Center</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Description:</strong> At the Help Center any benefited employee (including post-docs) and that employee’s dependents are eligible for up to 10 sessions of counseling. This can be individual, relationship or couple’s counseling, or family counseling. An employee can be eligible for additional counseling sessions at some point in the future if there is a significant life event that occurs or a different issue arises in their life they need support around; however, we aren’t able to provide ongoing counseling.We also provide departmental consultation, facilitated conversations, and individual coaching sessions. So, if a department needs support around creating a more inclusive workplace or would like workshops or trainings around queer issues, we can work to support those requests.Go to the website, click on About Us > Meet Our Staff to see our list of providers and our areas of expertise and interest. On our main page if you scroll down you can click on “Request a Counseling Appointment” to start the process of setting up an initial assessment session.</li>
